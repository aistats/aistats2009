<h1>AISTATS*09 Call for Papers</h1>
	 <h2>Twelfth International Conference on <br/>Artificial Intelligence and Statistics</h2>
         <h3>April 16-18, 2009, Clearwater, Florida USA</h3> 
 <!--<br> Collocated with the Learning Workshop, March 19-22, 2007</h3> -->
	 <p>This is the twelfth conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, an interdisciplinary gathering of researchers at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and related areas. Since its inception in 1985, the primary goal of this conference has been to broaden research in both of these fields by promoting the exchange of ideas between them. We encourage the submission of all papers which are in keeping with this objective.</p>
         <p>Presentations will include invited talks, contributed talks, and posters. Papers for poster sessions will be treated equally with papers for oral presentation in publications.</p>
         <p>Papers on all aspects of the interface between AI &amp; Statistics are strongly encouraged, including but not limited to:</p> 
         <ul>
            <li>Active learning and experimental design</li>
            <li>Approximate and Monte Carlo Inference</li>
