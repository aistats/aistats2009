<h1>AISTATS*09 Art Expo</h1>



<h3>
We are proud to announce the first<br>
Exhibition of AISTATS ART
</h3>
<p>
You are invited to visualize your favorite algorithm, by using it to create an attractive image. The input data will be either (1) an image provided by us (imposed theme) OR (2) any image you like (free theme). 
<p>
You will
<ul>
<li> run your favourite algorithm with the image as "data", with any 	preprocessing/postprocessing you want</li>
<li> display the algorithm's output as an image</li>
<li> give it a neat title </li>
<li> send us the image + title + a one page description of how the image was obtained </li>
</ul>
<p>
The goal is to produce both an artistic effect and, more importantly,
an interesting and surprising visualization of an algorithm. Think of
what would be catching in the eyes of your fellows AISTATS
participants. Do the unexpected! Avertise your own work! Anybody can
create a pretty image with Photoshop, but can you produce a neat
result with a causal discovery/preference elicitation/manifold
learning/reiforcement learning/fraud detection/information retrieval
algoritmm? Can you use this picture to highlight something about your
algorithm? Be creative, be as original as you can!
<p>
Entry is open to anyone somehow connected with AISTATS or with the
AISTATS topics of interest. Our intention is to exhibit all the
submissions at the AISTATS 2009 conference and to let the participants
judge their merits. The curator reserves the right to reject entries
they consider irrelevant or inappropriate. Please send your entry in a
widely used format that we can display easily (pdf, ps, jpeg,..). By
submitting an entry, you are giving the AISTATS chairs the implicit
permission to display your submission in connection with AISTATS.
</p>
<p>
Our intention is to exhibit all the submissions at the AISTATS 2009
conference and to let the participants judge their merits. After the
conference, the Exhibition will be hosted on the AISTATS web site. It
is NOT necessary to participate in the AISTATS conference in order to
submit an entry.
